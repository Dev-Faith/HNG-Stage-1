## Pre-Deployment Checklist

Before deploying, ensure:

- [ ] All dependencies are in `package.json`
- [ ] `npm run build` works locally
- [ ] `npm run start:prod` works locally
- [ ] No hardcoded localhost URLs
- [ ] Environment variables are documented
- [ ] `.gitignore` excludes node_modules and dist
- [ ] README.md is complete
- [ ] Tests pass (`npm test`)
- [ ] Code is pushed to GitHub

---

## Testing Your Deployed API

Once deployed, test your API:

```bash
# Replace YOUR_DEPLOYED_URL with your actual URL
export API_URL="https://your-app.railway.app"

# Test health
curl $API_URL

# Create a string
curl -X POST $API_URL/strings \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"value":"hello world"}'

# Get all strings
curl "$API_URL/strings"

# Get specific string
curl "$API_URL/strings/hello%20world"

# Filter palindromes
curl "$API_URL/strings?is_palindrome=true"

# Natural language query
curl "$API_URL/strings/filter-by-natural-language?query=palindromic%20strings"

# Delete string
curl -X DELETE "$API_URL/strings/hello%20world"
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails

- Check Node.js version matches `engines` in package.json
- Ensure all dependencies are listed
- Check build logs for specific errors

### App Crashes on Start

- Check logs: `heroku logs --tail` or platform equivalent
- Verify start command: `npm run start:prod`
- Ensure port is read from `process.env.PORT`

### 404 Errors

- Verify base URL is correct
- Check CORS is enabled
- Review route paths

### Slow Response

- Check server region (closer is better)
- Consider upgrading plan
- Add caching if needed

---

## Monitoring

After deployment:

1. **Check Logs Regularly**

   ```bash
   # Railway
   railway logs

   # Heroku
   heroku logs --tail

   # Fly.io
   flyctl logs
   ```

2. **Monitor Performance**
   - Use platform dashboards
   - Check response times
   - Monitor error rates

3. **Set Up Alerts**
   - Configure uptime monitoring
   - Set up error notifications
   - Monitor resource usage

---

## Scaling

As your app grows:

- **Vertical Scaling**: Upgrade to larger instance
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Add more instances
- **Add Database**: Replace in-memory storage
- **Add Caching**: Redis for performance
- **CDN**: For static assets

---

## Security Best Practices

- [ ] Use HTTPS (enabled by default on most platforms)
- [ ] Add rate limiting for production
- [ ] Implement authentication if needed
- [ ] Keep dependencies updated
- [ ] Monitor security vulnerabilities

---

## Next Steps

After successful deployment:

1. Test all endpoints thoroughly
2. Share your API URL
3. Monitor logs for errors
4. Gather user feedback
5. Plan database integration for persistence

---

## Support

For deployment issues:

- Check platform documentation
- Review application logs
- Join platform community forums
- Open issues on GitHub
